## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
### In this principle class should be having one and only one responsibility .in other words , A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.


## For example :
we have Student class that have some information about students , we want to print these information .
should we add it in Student class ?
should we add all updates to that class? 
we don't need too do that .
SRP tells us that each class is resobonsible for one thing .
that make our project more maintainble and flexible .
