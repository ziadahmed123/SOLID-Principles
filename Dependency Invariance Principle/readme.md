## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions. Abstractions shouldn't depend on details . Details should depend on apstractions


## For example : 
in our example before we apply DIP we make relation between the the 2 classes (DeliveryDriver - DeliveryCompany ) . 
it isn't good to do that so that we apply DIP to make  classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes .
