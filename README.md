# SOLID-principles
## Overview  : 
### The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure. The reason for that principles is that "To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on."

We have 5 principles 
1-	Single responsibility principle 
2-	Open _ closed principle 
3-	Liskov substitution principle
4-	Interface segregation principle
5-	Dependency inversion principle 




## 1- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
In this principle class should be having one and only one responsibility .in other words ,
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.






## 2- Open / Closed Principle
It means that classes are open for extension and closed for modification.
When we use this principle We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class. This is because whenever we modify the existing code, we are taking the risk of creating potential bugs. So we should avoid touching the tested and reliable (mostly) production code if possible.




## 3- Liskov Substitution Principle
This principle means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class. in other words it means that  if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.




## 4- Interface Segregation Principle
it simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.





## 5- Dependency Inversion Principle
