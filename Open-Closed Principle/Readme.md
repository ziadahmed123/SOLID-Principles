## Open / Closed Principle
### It means that classes are open for extension and closed for modification. When we use this principle We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class. This is because whenever we modify the existing code, we are taking the risk of creating potential bugs. So we should avoid touching the tested and reliable (mostly) production code if possible.
